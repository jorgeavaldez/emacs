# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents working in this repository.

## Core rules
- Source of truth is `config.org`.
- Do **not** hand-edit `config.el` (generated by Org Babel).
- Keep changes small and incremental.
- Prefer built-in Emacs features first; add packages only with clear justification.

## File roles
- `init.el`: bootstrap only.
- `config.org`: literate configuration and explanations.
- `.gitignore`: excludes generated/runtime files.

## Workflow expectations
- Preserve comments and explanations in `config.org`.
- When adding behavior, document it near the code block.
- Avoid broad rewrites unless explicitly requested.
