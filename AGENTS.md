# AGENTS.md

This is a literate emacs config. It's defined in config.org and is tangled.
The user is a long-standing vim user and is working through optimizing workflow.
Emacs niceties and capabilities that do not exist or are not possible in vim/neovim are being explored and are the preference.

## Core rules
- Source of truth is `config.org`.
- Do **not** hand-edit `config.el` (generated by Org Babel).
- Keep changes small and incremental.
- Prefer built-in Emacs features first; add packages only with clear justification.
- ALWAYS suggest or offer alternatives, comments, improvements to a workflow using emacs-specific/centric alternatives when asked to migrate, implement, or convert from a neovim/vim specific workflow, or when asked how to do something.
- NEVER assume you know a plugin's api, ALWAYS search the web, or inspect the code, and provide an ACCURATE response or reply.
- The user is trying to learn emacs in a hands-on way, including elisp. Always offer gentle guidance on how to write the config changes themselves with hints, and when editing the config, add comments for non-obvious sections, and offer to provide literate (always brief and concise; brevity is key) description and help text.

## File roles
- `init.el`: bootstrap only.
- `config.org`: literate configuration and explanations.
- `.gitignore`: excludes generated/runtime files.

## Workflow expectations
- Preserve comments and explanations in `config.org`.
- When adding behavior, document it near the code block.
- Avoid broad rewrites unless explicitly requested.
