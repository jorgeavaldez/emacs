#+title: Jorge's Emacs Config

A bespoke, from-scratch, literate Emacs configuration.

* Goals
- Keep everything understandable.
- Stay close to existing Neovim workflow where it helps.
- Grow incrementally from a minimal baseline.

* Structure
- =init.el=: tiny bootstrap file.
- =config.org=: source of truth (literate config with explanations + code).
- =config.el=: generated from =config.org= (ignored in git).

* How it works
On startup, =init.el= loads =config.org= via Org Babel:
1. Tangle Emacs Lisp blocks into =config.el=
2. Load =config.el=

* Quick start
- Open Emacs normally (with this directory as your config path/symlinked =~/.emacs.d=).
- Edit =config.org= for all real changes.
- Restart Emacs (or reload) to apply.

* Notes
Do not hand-edit =config.el=; it is generated output.
